# DS3DXMLImporter

Welcome to **DS3DXMLImporter**! This project provides a robust solution for importing and parsing 3DXML files (V5 and V6) directly into Unity. With its advanced features and performance-focused design, the importer ensures seamless integration of 3DXML content into Unity projects.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Support for 3DXML V5 and V6**:
  - Fully compatible with both versions of the 3DXML format.

- **Comprehensive Data Extraction**:
  - Loads all essential elements, including:
    - Product structures
    - Geometric elements
    - Colors and material information
    - Normals and surface attributes

- **Matrix Conversion**:
  - Accurate conversion of transformation matrices for precise placement and orientation of objects.

- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Cutting-edge optimizations for:
    - Efficient parsing of XML data.
    - Reduced memory allocations.
    - Multi-threaded processing for faster loading of large datasets.

---

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Parse the 3DXML File**:
   - The loader parses the 3DXML archive to extract its content.
   - Handles both embedded and external references seamlessly.

2. **Extract and Process Data**:
   - Reads the manifest to identify references and structures.
   - Converts geometry data (vertices, normals, colors) into Unity's native mesh format.

3. **Create Unity Objects**:
   - Generates Unity GameObjects with meshes, materials, and hierarchies matching the original 3DXML data.

4. **Optimized Integration**:
   - Minimizes memory overhead and maximizes frame-rate stability during runtime.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DS3DXMLImporter.git`

2. Open your Unity project and add the importer as a package or directly include the `Assets/DS3DXMLImporter` folder.

## 💻 Usage

After adding the importer package, you can begin parsing and loading 3DXML files into Unity with the **DS3DXMLParser**.

```
using DS3DXMLImporter;

public class ExampleUsage : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        DS3DXMLParser parser = new DS3DXMLParser(); 
        parser.OnParseCompleted += OnParseCompleted; 
        parser.OnParseProgressionChanged += OnParseProgressionChanged; 
        
        // Replace 'FILE_PATH' with your actual file path
        ILoader loader = LoaderFactory.CreateFileLoader("path/to/your/file.3dxml"); 
        
        // Start parsing the structure with a scale factor of 1.0f
        parser.ParseStructure(loader, 1f);
    }

    private void OnParseProgressionChanged(float progress)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Parsing progress: {progress * 100}%");
    }

    private void OnParseCompleted(DS3DXMLStructure structure)
    {
        Debug.Log("3DXML parsing completed successfully!");
    }
}
```

## 🏎️ Performance Optimizations

- **Preallocated Data Structures**:
  - Reduces unnecessary dynamic resizing of collections.

- **Multi-threaded Parsing**:
  - Leveraging multi-core CPUs for faster processing.

- **Efficient Memory Management**:
  - Ensures minimal garbage collection overhead during runtime.

- **Optimized Geometry Processing**:
  - Uses batching and streamlined workflows to handle large datasets effectively.

## 🛡️ Limitations

- Currently, this loader supports most standard 3DXML features but may not cover all edge cases or custom extensions.
- Large files with highly detailed geometry may take longer to process due to their complexity.
